Make has been replaced with r.js. To build the project, you'll need:

- r.js (npm install requirejs)
- almond.js (copy it from https://github.com/jrburke/almond to the root directory)
- eve.js (copy it from https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/eve to the root directory)

Then run:

    r.js -o r.build.js
    
This will compile everything to raphael.js, and it should work the same as before. There's
no need to use RequireJS or another AMD loader to load Raphael.       

However, if you want to use AMD:

1. Use the module defined in raphael.amd.js instead of raphael.js.
2. You'll need to have eve.js in the root of your project (or somewhere else, with a path mapping for 'eve').
